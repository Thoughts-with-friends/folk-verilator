Thanks for taking the time to report this.

Can you please attach an example that shows the issue or missing feature?  (Must be openly licensed, completely self-contained so can directly run what you provide. Ideally use test_regress format, see https://veripool.org/guide/latest/contributing.html?highlight=test_regress#reporting-bugs)

What output from that test indicates it is wrong, and what is the correct or expected output?  (Or, please make test self-checking if possible.)

What 'verilator' command line do we use to run your example?

What 'verilator --version' are you using?  Did you try it with the git master version?  Did you try it with other simulators?

What OS and distribution are you using?

May we assist you in trying to fix this in Verilator yourself?

(Please avoid attaching screenshots that show text - you can convert images to text using e.g. https://ocr.space)
